Once more into the fray 
Into the last good fight I'll never know 
Live and die on this day... 
Live and die on this day.. 

Once more into the fray 
I'll give my best fight and pray 
Once more into this war 
Trying to get far away 
Trying to live and to not die this day 
Keeping my soul clean raising it up 
Cleaning my sweat since I'll never give up 
Freezing my veins to don't feel the pain 
Don't say about leave because I remain 
Working hard and until death giving my best 
I wont stop until then when I'll stay in rest 
Since then my fight will be over 
Now my soul and body are bleeding 
I'm searching for the cure to keep living 
I feel the vibration in my soul 
Trying to get out being free 
To live forever and to not pray 
To live forever and to not count the DAY
